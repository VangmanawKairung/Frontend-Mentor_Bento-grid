## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass CSS (Scss)
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design
- Lazy loading
- Typography (Google Font)
- Accessibility Features
- SCSS features

### What I learned

Through this challenge, I enhanced my skills in semantic HTML5, SCSS, and responsive design. I learned to use CSS Grid and Flexbox for dynamic layouts, SCSS mixins for reusable code, and lazy loading for performance optimization. I also focused on accessibility with ARIA attributes, ensuring an inclusive user experience.

### Continued development

I plan to explore advanced SCSS features, improve animations and transitions for smoother interactions, and enhance accessibility with more ARIA practices. Additionally, I aim to refine my workflow with tools like React or Tailwind for building more dynamic and scalable projects.

### Useful resources

- [vertical-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/vertical-align) - This site demonstartes how to use `vertical-align` property.
- [Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading) - This shows the ability and how to use the attribute `lazy`.
